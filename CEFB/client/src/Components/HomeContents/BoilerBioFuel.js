                <p className='paraghraph'>
                    Biofuel-boilers are boilers that use biofuel instead of typical boilers that use fossil
                    fuels (such as petroleum). Biofuel is a "clean" liquid fuel obtained from renewable
                    sources, in particular vegetables oils, animal fats, cooking oils and plants.

                    It is very convenient for a business to use Biomass boilers because it has different source
                    of energy like wood, crops, industrial waste and food waste for biomass heating, instead of
                    just petroleum.
                    <br />
                    If you are a restaurant then you will be having waste of cooking oils, animal fat and etc.
                    So instead of throwing it in a bin, you can use it to power up your boiler and save money by
                    recycling your wastage.
                    <br />

                    rooms both commercially and domestically.
                    <br />
                    Biomass boilers are not difficult or have disadvantages because it works as same as a normal
                    boiler but in a more efficient way, which makes it an ideal renewable heating solution.
